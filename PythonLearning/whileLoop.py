#Python provides two main ways to loop round a block of code: for loops and while loops
#For loops can be used to iterate over an iterable. Sometimes we need to keep looping as long as some condition is True
#and stop when it becomes false. We do this using While loop

i = 0
while i<10:
    print("i is now {}".format(i))
    i+=1
