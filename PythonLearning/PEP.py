# A PEP is a python enhancement proposal
# All changes and new features to the python language start with a proposal
# The proposal is reviewed, discussed, improved if necessary, then either accepted or rejected

# Untill 2018, Guido van Rossum made the final decision about whether to implement a PEP or not
# Since then, the decision is taken by a group of people
