#Python 3 has 5 sequence types built in:
#   The String type
#   list
#   tuple
#   range
#   bytes and bytearray

#A sequence is defined as the ordered set of items. For example, the word "HELLO WORLD" contains 11 items, and each
#item is a character.

#A list is also a sequence type. For example, here's a Python list of things you might need, when buying a new computer
#["computer", "monitor", "keyboard", "mouse", "mouse mat"]
